# Testing with 3rd party software # 

## Testing with `logger` ##
To test `mcjoin` with a 3rd party software, you can use `logger`:

**On Receiver:**
````bash
mcjoin
````

**On Sender:**
````bash
while true; do logger -n 225.1.2.3 -P 1234 "Test message"; sleep 0.5; done
````
### Result ###
Since `logger` does not send the expected packets the receiver, it will indicate error
